            Ratio analysis is a fundamental analysis technique that enables
            investors to gain deeper insights into a company's financial
            performance. It does so by comparing different financial ratios to
            evaluate a company's financial health, profitability, efficiency,
            and stability over time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#ADB0D2] text-sm mb-6">
            Ticker Financial ratio analysis provides a unique approach to
            interpreting a company's financial data. By comparing a company's
            ratios with industry averages, peer companies, or its historical
            data, investors can identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses. For
            example, a high return on equity (ROE) ratio indicates strong
            profitability, while a high debt-to-equity ratio suggests a higher
            level of financial risk involved.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#ADB0D2] text-sm mb-6">
            Ticker provides thousands of such financial ratios. You should get
            started with the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), earnings per
            share (EPS), price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), and dividend yield
            ratios to understand a stock better. Each of these ratios provides a
            different perspective on a company's financial performance and
            valuation. Using the Ticker stock analyzer, you can log in to your
            account and add multiple ratios from the Company Essentials box and
            see them in all company analysis pages.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-[#ADB0D2] text-sm mb-6">
            Balance sheet analysis is an important part of fundamental analysis
            which focuses on measuring a company's assets, liabilities, and
            shareholders' equity. By analyzing a company's balance sheet,
            investors can learn about its financial stability, leverage, and
            capital structure.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#ADB0D2] text-sm mb-6">
            The balance sheet feature in Ticker provides a snapshot of a
            company's financial position in the past 5 years. It provides data
            points about the company's assets, such as cash, inventory,
            property, and equipment, as well as its liabilities, such as debt
            and accounts payable. The shareholders' equity section reflects the
            company's net worth.
          </p>
          <p className="text-[#ADB0D2] text-sm mb-6">
            By analyzing a companyâ€™s balance sheet, investors can deep dive into
            the health of a company's assets and liabilities, assess its
            liquidity and solvency, and determine the level of financial risk
            that the company brings as an investment option in their portfolio.
            For example, a high proportion of long-term debt relative to equity
            may indicate higher leverage and financial vulnerability in the
            company.
